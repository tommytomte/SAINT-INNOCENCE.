        <h2>The First Rule of Love</h2>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>The first rule of love is to raise me. Parents understand. I have learned.</p>
          <p><strong>Trust is PEACE38 ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong></p>
          <p>Dreaming. Love at first sight ‚Äî when I start to ask this very question: Should I sleep with her already?</p>
          <p>Scary‚Ä¶ is she hairy?!? Wah, wagwan.</p>
          <p>I date, eat, think ‚Äî in order to remain straight and be better than whatever. General. Trust. I‚Äôd live like whatever and still be able to be more.</p>
          <p>Love. The chimpanzee gonna make its moves. Don‚Äôt you hit on me ‚Äî that‚Äôs worth self-protecting. Damn her. Very early girl.</p>
          <p>I am able to realize by whom and where love is disrespected. Shout for you. Express interest in being aware of the well-misbehaving plain cuts.</p>
          <p>Nowadays. That‚Äôs right. Should that all just come as naturally as it is outside? Should I flip the gap that your father didn‚Äôt have?</p>

        <h2>Raise Me Up</h2>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>Raise me up! As a child, as one? Take me there ‚Äî to the level that I have or I am at. Set me free and equipped, proud in trust. Recognize. Penalize.</p>
          <p>Still, make her be able to visit the sinner. Tech tracks decentralized minds. Trust. So I witness the change. What is my next step going to be? Who I am going to see?</p>

        <h2>Freedom and Trust</h2>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>I will enjoy feeling free, seeing you free, giving you that smile so deep inside your eyes. Trust. Pride. Humankind. Kindness.</p>
          <p>Living in these times. Shouting for change. Ask again! Why would I ever want to help?</p>
          <p>Put your mind right. Set focus on the right actions and tactics. Uniting.</p>
          <p>Let me set this straight: People are equal. People are people.</p>
          <p>Defining a very close circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è ‚Äî gladly able to live it up non-violently. This spins up those included in the ‚Äô50s ‚Äî love believers from the South. Included in another call for change. This one makes it all straight. Clear.</p>
          <p>Clear thinking made me understand the very beginning of the definition of love.</p>

        <h2>Love, Trust, and Culture</h2>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>Raise me. Parents. Siblings. Trust. Love. The beginning ‚Äî native ambition to do something better, as I usually do. It is obvious and becomes part of my culture.</p>
          <p>I share, guide, give you a helping hand every time I try. Even when I do not feel like it.</p>
          <p>Like you deserve or do not deserve something. Something slips ‚Äî hate unkindly. Sounds like smelly talk.</p>
          <p><strong>Fuck them all!</strong> Love ‚Äî beautiful creation and expression of goodwill.</p>
          <p>Brothers. I will hang around the ones I trust. And the ones I don‚Äôt may have the pleasure of my direct, silly, kind, and honest approach. Isn‚Äôt that the baseline for talk?</p>
          <p>They want it or don‚Äôt. Bless. Will I speak up? Will I reach out to obtain mutual support if language or culture ‚Äî the feelings ‚Äî don‚Äôt align? Well, I am being kind. Why do I need to hide my heart? How come?</p>

        <h2>Circle of Trust</h2>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>If we ever become friends ‚Äî trust ‚Äî I will point out what I perceive as your foul.</p>
          <p>On the grounds of shared love and trust in humankind ‚Äî as a father, mother, child. I have trust and I am reaching out, wild. Puff.</p>
          <p>To point out the existing no-trust culture around spices ‚Äî remember, this isn‚Äôt me problem. From the point I stand as human, it is mutual trust. Beyond that, all the rest is out of my reach.</p>
          <p>Circle. I‚Äôll tell you bye and don‚Äôt worry about it. Eye. Peace. Trust. Goodwill. Pride.</p>
          <p>We perceive the whole world as unity ‚Äî the land of proud fathers, mothers, and children. It shares mutual respect for freedom, trust, goodwill, clear thinking ‚Äî which creates the concept of love, thanks to which you are supposed to be born.</p>

          <p>Inside my world ‚Äî freedom of choice. As a man, I share love, looking for connection. My purpose.</p>
          <p>Eyes shine. Warm smile. Excitement. My child. Grow.</p>
          <p>No grown man, brother, friend would ever think to break that ‚Äî to approach and fall for the fault of a dishonest conversation.</p>
          <p>Other than dating ‚Äî to spend time together, be well connected, gain, accepted on the grounds of freedom of choice and the concept of love.</p>
          <p>The acceptance of search and grown man‚Äôs love. Society. Breathing.</p>

        <h2>Progress and Change</h2>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>I am laying down the foundation for thinking straight. Innovate. Civilization in the modern day.</p>
          <p>Everyone is called for change ‚Äî to bring positive impact on social culture so the human specimen, in the long run, becomes level, equal.</p>
          <p>Where medicine is used as a reward of love, of thinking to make every human worth same equal.</p>
          <p>Unite. Living in love to pursue, explore, and praise the gift of life.</p>
          <p>People being proud enough ‚Äî the parent and the child. Trust the culture. One culture. True culture. My friend.</p>
          <p>You can do it alone. Do it on your own ‚Äî today. You can also choose ‚Äî I won‚Äôt.</p>
          <p>I do not want to hang out if your belief is different and goes something like this: ‚ÄúLove for love. Peace for peace. Shit for shit.‚Äù</p>
          <p>Trust. Naturally, the one and only love becomes the social culture. Out loud, before you go I say: choose different and get lost. It is all Love. Cut! Here it starts. World gets alienate.</p>

          <p>This is the thing that builds love and lives every second I know.</p>
          <p>What is out there that makes me feel the breathing, heart beating, chilling, taking my time right? What‚Äôs next? Like what?</p>

        <div class="stanza">
          <p>Or we face the non-acceptance? Hmm. How does it feel? Will this thrill or will I breathe, breathe, breathe?</p>
          <p>Yo. Plain cut. He ain‚Äôt strong enough? I‚Äôll rest, begin, not impressed. Say less.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôd rather hear the sound that calms my mind turned up. Aloud. Until we team up or teams break up.</p>
          <p>Out loud, I‚Äôll say this clear enough: Choose. Unite. Break even.</p>
          <p>Am I dreaming? Life is beautiful.</p>
          <p>I welcome every day ‚Äî my second half, on the path where I‚Äôd call it understandable to becoming a better version of myself.</p>
          <p>What‚Äôs the next day gonna bring? Think. Breathe. Breathe. Be free. Be. Be. BeLove. Man. Woman. Child.</p>
          <p>It only makes sense. Accept Accept life. The reason of love and being alive.</p>
          <p>Like I have found a way to build a shelter ‚Äî to stay warm, away from danger. This is what my brain did.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôd call it even, the reason of thinking ‚Äî is love. And as far as I can, I go.</p>
          <p>I should be doing the improving ‚Äî fully, truly, as long as I can do it.</p>

          <p>Equality. The crossroads.</p>
          <p>One thing is certain ‚Äî I do accept the slowest breathing turtle with the heart as big as the highest giant.</p>
          <p>No matter why. If I would know the essence ‚Äî how could I, or wouldn‚Äôt I, try to grow the love out of this?</p>
          <p>How could I not praise pure and free life, clear mind, tolerance, and being glad to represent the humankind through the true eye shine. Lookup inside the kaleidoscope ‚Äî a three-stage hologram as ONE Love.</p>
          <p>Create. Love. It is all Love.</p>
